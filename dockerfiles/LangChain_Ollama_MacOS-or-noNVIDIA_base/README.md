# LangChain_Ollama_MacOS-or-noNVIDIA_base  

**Description:** The `LangChain_Ollama_MacOS-or-noNVIDIA_base` directory contains the setup for using LangChain and Ollama on MacOS systems without NVIDIA GPUs. The main component is a `Dockerfile` that installs LangChain via pip and Ollama using a downloaded shell script, without GPU passthrough. This configuration is suitable for individuals who do not have access to NVIDIA GPUs or are using MacOS. Once the container is built and run from this directory, LangChain will be available for use through Ollama.

 ## Dockerfile

**Description:** This `Dockerfile` is used for creating a container without GPU requirements or for MacOS users. It installs LangChain and Ollama within the container, using pip for LangChain and a shell script downloaded from Ollama's website for installation. The models directory for Ollama is set to `/myapp/LLM-models`. Once these packages are installed, the container is prepared to serve LangChain via Ollama.
