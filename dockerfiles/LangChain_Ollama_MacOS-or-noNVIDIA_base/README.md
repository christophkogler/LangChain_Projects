# LangChain_Ollama_MacOS-or-noNVIDIA_base  

**Description:**  The `LangChain_Ollama_MacOS-or-noNVIDIA_base` directory contains the setup for using LangChain and Ollama on MacOS systems without NVIDIA GPUs. The main component is a `Dockerfile` that installs LangChain via pip and Ollama using a downloaded shell script, without GPU passthrough. This configuration is suitable for individuals who do not have access to NVIDIA GPUs or are using MacOS. Once the container is built and run from this directory, LangChain will be available for use through Ollama.

 ## Dockerfile

**Description:** This `Dockerfile` is used to create a container for running LangChain and Ollama without requiring NVIDIA GPUs or MacOS with GPU passthrough. The file installs both packages inside the container. LangChain is installed via pip, while Ollama is installed using a shell script obtained from its website. The models directory for Ollama is set to `/myapp/LLM-models`. Once these packages are installed, the container is prepared to serve LangChain through Ollama.
