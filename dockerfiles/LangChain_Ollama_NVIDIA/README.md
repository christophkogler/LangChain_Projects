# LangChain_Ollama_NVIDIA  

**Description:** The `LangChain_Ollama_NVIDIA` directory is a project setup for building and running a Python application utilizing NVIDIA GPUs, Retrieveal Augmented Generation (RAG), and models from Ollama. It consists of two main directories: `base` and `RAG`. The `base` directory handles the primary configuration and setup files for both Windows and Linux systems, including a Dockerfile that installs necessary packages and sets up a Python environment. The `RAG` directory contains resources and configurations specific to RAG, such as a Dockerfile defining dependencies and storing Ollama models within the container image.

 ## base

This directory serves as the foundation for building and running a Python application using NVIDIA GPUs on both Windows and Linux systems. It includes a `Dockerfile` that sets up a Python environment, installs necessary packages such as LangChain and the NVIDIA Container Toolkit, and configures Ollama's models directory.

## RAG

The RAG directory is dedicated to resources and configurations for a Python application using Retrieveal Augmented Generation (RAG). It contains a `Dockerfile` defining steps to build a container image with dependencies like NVIDIA Container Toolkit, Ollama, LangChain, BeautifulSoup, ChromaDB, cmake, unstructured, and specific Natural Language Toolkit packages. The Ollama models are stored within the container image in `/myapp/LLM-models`.
