# LangChain_Ollama_NVIDIA  

**Description:** The `LangChain_Ollama_NVIDIA` directory is the main project folder that includes essential configurations and setup files for building and running a Python application using NVIDIA GPUs on both Windows and Linux systems. It consists of two primary directories: `base` and `RAG`.

The `base` directory contains the primary configuration files for setting up a Python environment, installing necessary packages such as LangChain and the NVIDIA Container Toolkit, and configuring Ollama's models directory.

The `RAG` directory holds the resources and configuration files for building and running a Python application using Docker. It includes a Dockerfile that sets up a Python container image with additional dependencies such as NVIDIA Container Toolkit, Ollama, BeautifulSoup, ChromaDB, cmake, unstructured, and pathlib. The Ollama models directory is located within the container at `/myapp/LLM-models`.

 ## base

This directory is dedicated to the primary configuration and setup for building and running a Python application using NVIDIA GPUs on both Windows and Linux systems. It includes a `Dockerfile` that establishes a Python environment, installs essential packages such as LangChain and the NVIDIA Container Toolkit, and configures Ollama's models directory.

## RAG

The RAG directory serves the purpose of building and running a Python application using Docker. It contains a `Dockerfile` that sets up a Python container image with additional dependencies including NVIDIA Container Toolkit, Ollama, BeautifulSoup, ChromaDB, cmake, unstructured, and pathlib. The Ollama models directory is located within the container at `/myapp/LLM-models`.
