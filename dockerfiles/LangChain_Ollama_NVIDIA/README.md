# LangChain_Ollama_NVIDIA  

**Description:** The `LangChain_Ollama_NVIDIA` directory is a project setup containing two main components: `base` and `RAG`. The `base` directory provides a Docker environment for running Python applications with NVIDIA GPUs on both Windows and Linux systems. It includes a Dockerfile that installs LangChain, Ollama, and configures the NVIDIA Container Toolkit. The `RAG` directory, on the other hand, is a development environment setup for Retrieveal Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. It includes a Dockerfile that builds a Python-based container image with necessary dependencies, such as NVIDIA Container Toolkit, Ollama, LangChain, and various Natural Language Toolkit packages. This setup aims to facilitate consistent RAG application development across different systems.

 ## base

This directory contains the Docker environment setup for running Python applications with NVIDIA GPUs on both Windows and Linux systems. It includes a `Dockerfile` that sets up a Python image, installs LangChain and Ollama, configures the NVIDIA Container Toolkit, and sets the Ollama models directory.

## RAG

The `RAG` directory holds the development environment setup for Retrieveal Augmented Generation (RAG). It includes a `Dockerfile` that builds a Python-based container image with necessary dependencies, including NVIDIA Container Toolkit, Ollama, LangChain, and various Natural Language Toolkit packages. The image also pre-installs chainlit for a chat UI, facilitating the development of RAG applications using a consistent environment across different systems.
