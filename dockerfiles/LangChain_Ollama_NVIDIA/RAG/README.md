# RAG  

**Description:** The `RAG` directory contains the development environment setup for Retrieveal Augmented Generation (RAG). It includes a `Dockerfile` that builds a Python-based container image with necessary dependencies, such as NVIDIA Container Toolkit, Ollama, LangChain, BeautifulSoup, ChromaDB, cmake, unstructured, and various Natural Language Toolkit packages. The image also pre-installs chainlit for an easy chat UI. This setup is designed to facilitate the development of RAG applications using a consistent environment across different systems.

 ## Dockerfile

**Description:** This `Dockerfile` provides instructions to build a Python-based container image with necessary dependencies for Retrieveal Augmented Generation. It starts from a base Python image, installs GPU passthrough tools (NVIDIA Container Toolkit), LLM serving tool (Ollama), required libraries and packages such as LangChain, BeautifulSoup, ChromaDB, cmake, unstructured, pathlib, and some Natural Language Toolkit packages. It also pre-downloads these packages and installs chainlit for a user-friendly chat UI.
