# dockerfiles  

**Description:**  The `dockerfiles` directory contains project setups and configurations for using LangChain and Ollama with Docker on various systems: MacOS without NVIDIA GPUs and Windows/Linux with NVIDIA GPUs. It includes directories named `LangChain_Ollama_MacOS-or-noNVIDIA_base` and `LangChain_Ollama_NVIDIA`, each containing a Dockerfile, configuration files, and scripts for installing and setting up the respective environments. The MacOS setup does not require NVIDIA GPUs or GPU passthrough, while the NVIDIA setup utilizes GPU passthrough for both Windows and Linux systems.

 ## `LangChain_Ollama_MacOS-or-noNVIDIA_base`

This directory contains the setup for using LangChain and Ollama on MacOS systems without NVIDIA GPUs or GPU passthrough. It includes a Dockerfile to build a container for LangChain and Ollama without requiring GPUs.

## `Dockerfile` (in `LangChain_Ollama_MacOS-or-noNVIDIA_base`)

This Dockerfile installs LangChain via pip and Ollama using a shell script, creating a container for running LangChain through Ollama without NVIDIA GPUs or MacOS with GPU passthrough.

## `LangChain_Ollama_NVIDIA`

A project setup for building and running Python applications using NVIDIA GPUs on both Windows and Linux systems. It consists of two main directories: base and RAG, each with their Dockerfiles.

## `base` Directory (in `LangChain_Ollama_NVIDIA`)

The primary configuration files for setting up a Docker environment to run Python applications on NVIDIA GPUs on both Windows and Linux systems. It includes a Dockerfile that sets up a Python environment, installs necessary packages, and configures Ollama's models directory.

## `Dockerfile` (in base Directory)

Sets up a Docker environment for running Python applications on NVIDIA GPUs using a base Python image, installing LangChain and the NVIDIA Container Toolkit, and configuring Ollama's models directory.

## RAG Directory (in `LangChain_Ollama_NVIDIA`)

Contains resources and configuration files for building and running a Python application using Docker with additional dependencies installed. It includes a Dockerfile that sets up a Python container image, installs Ollama for LLM serving, and includes required packages. The Ollama models directory is located within the container at `/myapp/LLM-models`.

## `Dockerfile` (in RAG Directory)

Provides instructions to build a Python container image with additional dependencies installed, starting from a base Python image, setting up GPU passthrough using NVIDIA Container Toolkit, installing Ollama for LLM serving, and including required packages. The Ollama models directory is mounted to `/myapp/LLM-models`.
