# dockerfiles  

**Description:** The `dockerfiles` directory contains multiple projects, each with its own subdirectory and Dockerfile setup. The first project, `LangChain_Ollama_MacOS-or-noNVIDIA_base`, is designed for creating a container suitable for running LangChain and Ollama on MacOS systems without NVIDIA GPUs. The second project, `LangChain_Ollama_NVIDIA`, includes two subdirectories: `base` and `RAG`. The `base` directory sets up an environment for running Python applications with NVIDIA GPUs on both Windows and Linux systems. The `RAG` directory is a development environment setup for Retrieveal Augmented Generation (RAG) applications, which includes necessary dependencies such as NVIDIA Container Toolkit, Ollama, LangChain, and various Natural Language Toolkit packages.

 ## LangChain_Ollama_MacOS-or-noNVIDIA_base

This directory contains a Dockerfile for creating a container suitable for running LangChain and Ollama on MacOS systems without NVIDIA GPUs. It installs both packages using pip and shell scripts respectively, and sets up the models directory for Ollama at `/myapp/LLM-models`.

## LangChain_Ollama_NVIDIA

This project setup includes two main components: `base` and `RAG`. The `base` directory provides a Docker environment for running Python applications with NVIDIA GPUs on both Windows and Linux systems. It installs LangChain, Ollama, and configures the NVIDIA Container Toolkit. The `RAG` directory is a development environment setup for Retrieveal Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. It builds a Python-based container image with necessary dependencies, including NVIDIA Container Toolkit, Ollama, LangChain, and various Natural Language Toolkit packages.
