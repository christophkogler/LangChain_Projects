# dockerfiles  

**Description:** The `dockerfiles` directory contains two main project setups: `LangChain_Ollama_MacOS-or-noNVIDIA_base` and `LangChain_Ollama_NVIDIA`. The former is for using LangChain and Ollama on MacOS systems without NVIDIA GPUs, while the latter is for building and running a Python application with NVIDIA GPUs on both Windows and Linux systems. Each setup includes necessary files such as Dockerfiles, configuration scripts, and package installations.

 ## LangChain_Ollama_MacOS-or-noNVIDIA_base

This directory is for setting up LangChain and Ollama on MacOS systems without NVIDIA GPUs. It includes a `Dockerfile` that installs LangChain via pip and Ollama using a downloaded shell script, without GPU passthrough.

## LangChain_Ollama_NVIDIA

This is the main project folder for building and running a Python application using NVIDIA GPUs on both Windows and Linux systems. It consists of two primary directories: `base` and `RAG`.

The `base` directory sets up a Python environment, installs necessary packages, and configures Ollama's models directory for use with NVIDIA GPUs.

The `RAG` directory holds resources and configuration files for building and running a Python application using Docker with additional dependencies such as NVIDIA Container Toolkit, Ollama, BeautifulSoup, ChromaDB, cmake, unstructured, and pathlib.
