# dockerfiles  

**Description:** The `dockerfiles` directory contains two main project setups: `LangChain_Ollama_MacOS-or-noNVIDIA_base` and `LangChain_Ollama_NVIDIA`. The former is designed for using LangChain and Ollama on MacOS systems without NVIDIA GPUs, while the latter is optimized for utilizing NVIDIA GPUs, Retrieveal Augmented Generation (RAG), and models from Ollama. Each setup includes necessary files such as Dockerfiles for installing dependencies and setting up environments tailored to their respective configurations.

 ## LangChain_Ollama_MacOS-or-noNVIDIA_base

This directory setup enables the use of LangChain and Ollama on MacOS systems without NVIDIA GPUs. It includes a `Dockerfile` that installs LangChain via pip and Ollama using a downloaded shell script, without GPU passthrough. Suitable for individuals without access to NVIDIA GPUs or using MacOS.

## LangChain_Ollama_NVIDIA

This project setup facilitates building and running a Python application utilizing NVIDIA GPUs, Retrieveal Augmented Generation (RAG), and models from Ollama. It consists of two main directories: `base` and `RAG`. The `base` directory manages primary configuration and setup files for both Windows and Linux systems, including a Dockerfile installing necessary packages and setting up a Python environment. The `RAG` directory contains RAG-specific resources and configurations within the container image.
