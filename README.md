# LangChain_Projects  

**Description:**  The `LangChain_Projects` directory contains various Python projects and utilities designed for interacting with LangChain's vector search technology and models. It includes scripts for using LangChain's Language Model (LLM) with Ollama, setting up retrieval chains for question answering, interacting with ChromaDB, and summarizing the contents of directories or files. Additionally, it contains Dockerfiles and configuration files for setting up LangChain environments on different systems, including MacOS without NVIDIA GPUs and Windows/Linux with NVIDIA GPUs.

 ## `scripts` directory
This directory contains various Python scripts designed for interacting with LangChain's vector search technology and models.

### `basic_invoke.py`
An example script demonstrating the use of LangChain's Language Model (LLM) to generate responses based on given inputs using Ollama, specifically the Mistral model.

### `basic_retriever.py`
A script that sets up a retrieval chain for question answering using FAISS vectorstore and Ollama model, collecting documents, processing them, ingesting into the vectorstore, and creating a retrieval chain.

### `chromadb_utils.py`
Offers convenient utilities for interacting with ChromaDB, including functions to clear the database and configure a Mistral model.

### `directory_retrieve.py`
Retrieves information from a local directory using Langchain's vector search technology, loading documents, processing them, indexing in a Chroma vectorstore, and generating answers based on questions and context using an Ollama language model.

### `directory_summarizer.py`
Generates summaries for the contents of a given directory by analyzing each file and subdirectory, recursively.

### `LangChain_Ollama_MacOS-or-noNVIDIA_base`
A setup for using LangChain and Ollama on MacOS systems without NVIDIA GPUs or GPU passthrough. It includes a Dockerfile to build a container for LangChain and Ollama without requiring GPUs.

### `LangChain_Ollama_NVIDIA`
A project setup for building and running Python applications using NVIDIA GPUs on both Windows and Linux systems. It consists of two main directories: base and RAG, each with their Dockerfiles.

#### base Directory (in LangChain_Ollama_NVIDIA)
The primary configuration files for setting up a Docker environment to run Python applications on NVIDIA GPUs on both Windows and Linux systems. It includes a Dockerfile that sets up a Python environment, installs necessary packages, and configures Ollama's models directory.

#### RAG Directory (in LangChain_Ollama_NVIDIA)
Contains resources and configuration files for building and running a Python application using Docker with additional dependencies installed. It includes a Dockerfile that sets up a Python container image, installs Ollama for LLM serving, and includes required packages. The Ollama models directory is located within the container at `/myapp/LLM-models`.
