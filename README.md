# LangChain_Projects  

**Description:** The `LangChain_Projects` directory is a collection of files and subdirectories containing projects built using LangChain, an advanced language model and vector database library. It includes two main project setups: one for MacOS systems without NVIDIA GPUs and another for building and running Python applications with NVIDIA GPUs on both Windows and Linux systems. The directory also contains various Python scripts and utility files demonstrating different use cases of LangChain, such as setting up retrieval chains for question answering, generating file summaries, and interacting with the Mistral model and FAISS vectorstore. Additionally, there is a comprehensive guide (SETUP.md) on setting up a LangChain environment using Docker on Windows 10 with an NVIDIA GPU.

 ## dockerfiles

This directory contains two project setups for using LangChain and Ollama: one for MacOS systems without NVIDIA GPUs and another for building and running Python applications with NVIDIA GPUs on both Windows and Linux systems. Each setup includes essential files like Dockerfiles, configuration scripts, and package installations.

## scripts

The `scripts` directory holds various Python scripts and utility files demonstrating different use cases of LangChain. These scripts showcase capabilities such as setting up retrieval chains for question answering, generating file summaries, and interacting with the Mistral model and FAISS vectorstore.

## SETUP.md

This comprehensive guide outlines the process of setting up a LangChain environment using Docker on Windows 10 with an NVIDIA GPU. It explains the benefits of using Docker for creating consistent environments, provides instructions for installing Docker Desktop and its dependencies, and covers steps for running and modifying containers or building new images. Additionally, it addresses downloading and adding models to the container or image.
