# scripts  

**Description:** The `scripts` directory contains various Python scripts and utilities designed for different purposes using LangChain and Chainlit frameworks. These scripts include examples of generating responses based on user inputs (basic_invoke.py), setting up retrieval chains to answer questions from a vectorstore (basic_retriever.py), creating conversational AI chatbots (chainlit_general_chatbot.py, chainlit_python_assistant.py), summarizing files and directories using LangChain's large language model (directory_summarizer.py, file_summarizer.py), and functioning as a coding assistant for import suggestions (python_assistant.py). The scripts also include utilities to retrieve information from local directories (directory_retrieve.py) and generate Markdown summaries for directories (directory_summarizer.py). 

 ## `basic_invoke.py`
This script is an example of using LangChain's Ollama model for generating responses based on user inputs. It demonstrates installation requirements, initialization of the LLM, and creation of a prompt template and output parser.

## `basic_retriever.py`
This script sets up a retrieval chain to answer questions based on given context from a vectorstore using Ollama. It collects documents, processes them, ingests into a Chroma vectorstore, and creates a retrieval chain for question answering.

## `chainlit_general_chatbot.py`
This script designs a conversational AI using Chainlit and Ollama. The chatbot handles user input, determines user intentions, and responds accordingly while supporting loading and processing files during the conversation.

## `chainlit_python_assistant.py`
This script uses Chainlit for UI interactions and assists in solving problems or completing tasks related to a given file using Ollama. It sets up various Chains and serves Ollama, feeding outputs and errors to variables to keep the console clean.

## `chainlit_utils.py`
This script provides convenience functions for use within Chainlit UI. It interacts with the user to determine the working directory and filename, then searches for files with that name in the specified directory and its subdirectories.

## `common_utils.py`
This utility module provides several functions and variables used across various scripts in the project, including functions for interacting with databases and file paths.

## `directory_retrieve.py`
This script retrieves information from a local directory using Langchain's vector search technology, loads documents, processes them, indexes them into a Chroma vectorstore, and generates answers based on the question and context using an Ollama language model.

## `directory_summarizer.py`
This script generates concise descriptions and Markdown summaries for a given directory using Langchain's large language model. It reads the summaries of all files and subdirectories within the specified directory and writes brief descriptions for the directory itself and each item in the context.

## `file_summarizer.py`
This script summarizes the content of a given file using LangChain, sets up necessary components, initializes the Ollama model, reads the contents of the specified file, and passes it as input to the LangChain model for summarization.

## `python_assistant.py`
This Python script functions as a coding assistant using Langchain and Ollama, identifies imports, checks their usage, and suggests any missing or unused imports. It utilizes various Langchain components such as retrieval chains, document loaders, embeddings, LLMs, and vector stores.

## `start_chainlit_general_chatbot.py`
This script initiates the Chainlit general chatbot using the command-line tool 'chainlit run'. Upon execution, it starts the chatbot by invoking the command ['chainlit', 'run', '/myapp/LangChain_Projects/scripts/chainlit_general_chatbot.py'].
