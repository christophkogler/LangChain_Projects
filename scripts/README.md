# scripts  

**Description:** The `scripts` directory contains various Python scripts that utilize Langchain and its components, such as Ollama language model, Chroma vectorstore, Chainlit framework, and other utilities, to build applications with different functionalities. These applications include:

1. `basic_invoke.py`: An example script demonstrating how to use the Ollama model for generating responses based on user inputs.
2. `basic_retriever.py`: A script that sets up a retrieval chain to answer questions based on given context from a vectorstore using the Ollama model.
3. `chainlit_general_chatbot.py`: A conversational AI designed using Chainlit and Ollama for text-based conversations with users.
4. `chainlit_python_assistant.py`: An assistant script that uses Chainlit to help solve problems or complete tasks related to a given file.
5. `chainlit_utils.py`: A utility script providing convenience functions for use within Chainlit UI.
6. `common_utils.py`: A utility module with several functions and variables used across various scripts in the project.
7. `directory_retrieve.py`: A script that retrieves information from a local directory using Langchain's vector search technology.
8. `directory_summarizer.py`: A script generating concise descriptions and Markdown summaries for a given directory using Langchain's large language model.
9. `error_assistant.py`: A script designed to help diagnose and provide solutions for coding errors by utilizing the Langchain AI model, Ollama.
10. `file_summarizer.py`: A script that summarizes the content of a given file using the LangChain model.
11. `python_assistant.py`: A coding assistant script that helps improve codebase by suggesting necessary import adjustments using various Langchain components.

 ## `basic_invoke.py`
This script is an example of using LangChain's Ollama model for generating responses based on user inputs. It includes installation requirements, initialization of the LLM, and creation of a prompt template and output parser.

## `basic_retriever.py`
This script sets up a retrieval chain to answer questions based on given context from a vectorstore using the Ollama model. It collects documents from a webpage, processes them, ingests into a Chroma vectorstore, and creates a retrieval chain for question answering.

## `chainlit_general_chatbot.py`
This script creates a conversational AI using Chainlit and LangChain's Ollama model. The chatbot engages in text-based conversations with users and optionally processes files requested by the user.

## `chainlit_python_assistant.py`
This script uses Chainlit for UI interactions and assists in solving problems or completing tasks related to a given file using LangChain's Ollama model. It requires specific package installations and sets up an Ollama language model integrated with Chainlit.

## `chainlit_utils.py`
This utility script provides convenience functions for use within Chainlit UI, including interacting with the user to determine a working directory and file name, and locating and selecting a specific file based on its name.

## `common_utils.py`
This utility module provides several functions and variables used across various scripts in the project, including clearing the database of vectors and interacting with the user to locate a specific file.

## `directory_retrieve.py`
This script retrieves information from a local directory using LangChain's vector search technology, loading documents, processing them, indexing into a Chroma vectorstore, and generating answers based on questions and context using an Ollama language model.

## `directory_summarizer.py`
This script generates concise descriptions and Markdown summaries for a given directory using LangChain's large language model. It reads the summaries of all files and subdirectories within the specified directory and writes brief descriptions for each item.

## `error_assistant.py`
This script helps diagnose and provide solutions for coding errors by analyzing error messages and suggesting appropriate fixes based on context using LangChain's Ollama model.

## `file_summarizer.py`
This script summarizes the content of a given file using LangChain, generating a concise description of the file content. It assumes that the Ollama server is already running.

## `python_assistant.py`
This script functions as a coding assistant using LangChain and Ollama, identifying imports, checking their usage, and suggesting any missing or unused imports.
