# scripts  

**Description:** The 'scripts' directory contains various Python scripts designed to perform different tasks using LangChain's Language Model (LLM) and other related libraries. These scripts include:

1. `basic_invoke.py`: An example script demonstrating how to use LLM with Ollama, specifically the Mistral model, for generating responses based on given inputs.
2. `basic_retriever.py`: A script that sets up a retrieval chain to answer questions based on context from a vectorstore using BeautifulSoup and WebBaseLoader.
3. `chromadb_utils.py`: A utility script for interacting with ChromaDB, a vector database provided by the Langchain community, including functions to clear the DB and configure settings for a Mistral model.
4. `directory_retrieve.py`: A script that retrieves information from a local directory using Langchain's vector search technology and generates answers based on questions and context.
5. `directory_summarizer.py`: A script that recursively analyzes subdirectories and files within a given directory, generating summaries for each item using LangChain library.
6. `error_assistant.py`: A script intended to take in an error message and target file, retrieve relevant documents, generate instructions on fixing the error, and save the edited file with potential fixes.
7. `file_summarizer.py`: A script that summarizes descriptions for given files using LangChain model and indexes them in a vectorstore for retrieval.
8. `python_assistant.py`: A Python script designed to analyze a target file, list imports, and check each import for usage within the file, returning a list of missing or unused imports.

 ## `basic_invoke.py`
This script is an example of using LangChain's Language Model (LLM) with Ollama to generate responses based on given inputs. It includes installation requirements, initialization of the LLM, and a simple prompt template for user input, as well as an output parser.

## `basic_retriever.py`
This script sets up a retrieval chain to answer questions based on given context from a vectorstore using BeautifulSoup, WebBaseLoader, RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter, and OllamaEmbeddings.

## `chromadb_utils.py`
A utility script for interacting with ChromaDB, a vector database provided by the Langchain community. It includes functions to clear the ChromaDB of stored vectors and configuration settings for a Mistral model used in summarization tasks.

## `directory_retrieve.py`
This script retrieves information from a local directory using Langchain's vector search technology, loads documents, processes them, indexes them in a Chroma vectorstore, and generates answers based on the question and context using an Ollama language model.

## `directory_summarizer.py`
This script recursively analyzes subdirectories and files within a given directory, generating summaries for each item using LangChain's text processing tasks. It combines generated summaries into a single document for creating a README file for the directory.

## `error_assistant.py`
Intended to be a script that takes in an error message and a target file, retrieves relevant documents using Language Model (LLM) and vector database, generates instructions on fixing the error based on the retrieved information, and saves the edited file with potential fixes.

## `file_summarizer.py`
Designed to summarize descriptions for given files using a LangChain model, sets up necessary components, loads the file, processes it, uses an embedding model to index the document in a vectorstore, and invokes the LangChain model to generate a concise description for the given file based on its contents.

## `python_assistant.py`
A Python script that analyzes a given target file, lists imports, checks each import for usage within the file, and returns a list of missing or unused imports using Langchain, Ollama, and related libraries.
