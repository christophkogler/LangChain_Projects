# scripts  

**Description:** The `scripts` directory contains various Python scripts and utility files used in applications built with LangChain, an advanced language model and vector database library. These scripts demonstrate different use cases of LangChain, such as setting up retrieval chains for question answering, generating file summaries, and interacting with the Mistral model and FAISS vectorstore. The scripts include `basic_invoke.py`, `basic_retriever.py`, `chromadb_utils.py`, `directory_retrieve.py`, and `directory_summarizer.py`. Each script serves a specific purpose, like processing webpage documents or generating file descriptions, and they all utilize LangChain's capabilities to achieve their goals.

 ## `basic_invoke.py`

**Description:** This script demonstrates using LangChain's Language Model (LLM) with Ollama, specifically the Mistral model, for generating responses based on user inputs. It includes installation requirements, initialization of the LLM, and a simple prompt template. The output is parsed into a string format for easier handling.

## `basic_retriever.py`

**Description:** This script sets up a retrieval chain to answer questions based on given context using FAISS vectorstore and Ollama model. It collects documents, processes them, ingests them into the vectorstore, and creates a retrieval chain for question answering.

## `chromadb_utils.py`

**Description:** This file contains utility functions specific to ChromaDB, a vector database provided by Langchain library. It includes a convenience function called `purify_db()` that clears the database and a dictionary defining configuration settings for a Mistral model used with ChromaDB.

## `directory_retrieve.py`

**Description:** This script retrieves information from a local directory using Langchain's vector search technology. It loads documents, processes them, indexes them in a Chroma vectorstore, and sets up a retrieval chain for question answering.

## `directory_summarizer.py`

**Description:** This script generates machine-generated README.md files for directories using Langchain's Ollama model for text analysis. It summarizes the general purpose of each directory without explicitly describing their contents.

## `file_summarizer.py`

**Description:** This script generates concise descriptions for given files using a LangChain model. It sets up necessary components, including loading the file, creating a retrieval chain with an LLM like Ollama, and indexing the loaded document into a vector store. The script then invokes the retrieval chain to generate a description based on the input file name.
