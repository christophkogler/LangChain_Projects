# scripts  

**Description:**  The `scripts` directory contains various Python scripts and utilities designed for interacting with LangChain's vector search technology and models. These scripts include:

1. `basic_invoke.py`: An example of using the LangChain Language Model (LLM) to generate responses based on given inputs, featuring installation requirements, initialization, a simple prompt template, and an output parser.
2. `basic_retriever.py`: A script that sets up a retrieval chain for question answering using FAISS vectorstore and Ollama model, collecting documents from webpages, processing them, ingesting into the vectorstore, and creating a retrieval chain.
3. `chromadb_utils.py`: Offers convenient utilities for interacting with ChromaDB, including functions to clear the database and configure a Mistral model.
4. `directory_retrieve.py`: Retrieves information from a local directory using Langchain's vector search technology, loading documents, processing them, indexing in a Chroma vectorstore, and generating answers based on questions and context.
5. `directory_summarizer.py`: Generates summaries for the contents of a given directory by analyzing each file and subdirectory within it, recursively applying this process, and combining generated summaries to create an overall description.
6. `file_summarizer.py`: Generates concise descriptions for given files using LangChain models, setting up components, loading the file, creating a retrieval chain with an LLM, indexing the loaded document into a vector store, and invoking the retrieval chain to generate a description based on the input file name.

 ## `basic_invoke.py`

**Description:** This Python script demonstrates using LangChain's Language Model (LLM) with Ollama, specifically the Mistral model, to generate responses based on given inputs. It includes installation requirements, initialization of the LLM, and a simple prompt template for user input, as well as an output parser.

## `basic_retriever.py`

**Description:** This script is part of a LangChain application that sets up a retrieval chain to answer questions based on given context using the FAISS vectorstore and Ollama model. It collects documents, processes them, ingests them into the vectorstore, and creates a retrieval chain for question answering.

## `chromadb_utils.py`

**Description:** This Python script offers convenient utilities for interacting with ChromaDB, a vector database from the Langchain community. It requires specific packages and includes functions to clear the ChromaDB of existing vectors and define configurations for a Mistral model.

## `directory_retrieve.py`

**Description:** This script retrieves information from a local directory using Langchain's vector search technology. It loads documents, processes them, indexes them in a Chroma vectorstore, sets up a retrieval chain, and generates answers based on the question and context using an Ollama language model.

## `directory_summarizer.py`

**Description:** This script summarizes the contents of a given directory by analyzing each file and generating a summary for it. It recursively applies this process to any subdirectories within the given directory, then combines the generated summaries to create an overall description for the directory.

## `file_summarizer.py`

**Description:** This script generates concise descriptions for given files using a LangChain model. It sets up necessary components, including loading the file, creating a retrieval chain with an LLM like Ollama, and indexing the loaded document into a vector store, then invokes the retrieval chain to generate a description based on the input file name.
